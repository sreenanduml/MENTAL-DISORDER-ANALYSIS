                      # MENTAL-DISORDER-ANALYSIS

This project presents an interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a dashboard for mental health diagnosis using a small but insightful dataset of patient psychological profiles. The goal is to visualize behavioral and emotional patterns to aid in understanding and diagnosing mental health conditions like Depression, Bipolar Type-1, and Bipolar Type-2.

Emotional State: Sadness, Euphoric, Exhausted

Behavioral Traits: Mood Swing, Suicidal Thoughts, Overthinking, etc.

Psychological Metrics: Concentration, Optimism, Sexual Activity (scaled 1â€“10)

Expert Diagnosis: Depression, Bipolar Type-1, or Bipolar Type-2

The main goals of this project are:

To visualize emotional and behavioral patterns that contribute to mental health diagnosis

To compare patient symptoms across different types of diagnoses

To provide a quick, interactive tool for understanding psychological trends in a small dataset

To lay the foundation for potential diagnostic support systems using ML (future scope)

Key insights drawn during Exploratory Data Analysis:

Mood Swings and Suicidal Thoughts were more prevalent in bipolar disorders.

Patients with Depression showed lower levels of Concentration and Optimism.

Bipolar patients displayed higher occurrences of euphoric episodes and nervous breakdowns.

Distinct symptom clusters can be visualized across diagnosis types.
